## Summary
We combine geolocated fire data from The Economistâ€™s War Fire Dataset and military aid allocations from the Ukraine Support Tracker (Trebesch et al., 2023). Control maps from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), road networks from the World Bank (2023), and mineral deposit data from the USGS are used to test four geospatial hypotheses. In this figure, we separate war-related fires in Russian-controlled areas from those occuring in Ukrainina-controlled areas.
